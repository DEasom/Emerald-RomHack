How to Install and Play:
1. Download BOTH files listed to your desktop.
2. Open the GBA file using VisualBoyAdvance.
3. If your screen shows white follow the steps bellow.

Fixing White Screen:
Options Tab -> Emulator -> Save Type -> Flash 128K
Then
File Tab -> Reset
After these steps the game should restart and play.

Updating your ROM:
1. Download the new version listed to your desktop. 
   The file listed is the most updated version available.
2. Rename the .GBA file to match your previous save file.
   This save file is most likely somewhere on your desktop
   named 'YourFileName'.SAV
3. Once the .GBA file name matches the .SAV file name you
   can open the new .GBA file in VisualBoyAdvance and it 
   will load your old save with the updated ROM.
   
IMPORTANT: I suggest walking into and leaveing a near
           building or route to reload the area you start
           in as changes dont go into effect until the map
           is reloaded. Not reloading the map can cause 
           a number of issues.
